MobSF will perform a static analysis of an application and emit a report containing a security score. It is similar to what other scanner apps such as Nessus, OpenVAS and Nikto do, only for mobile applications. It is a good starting point for an auditing process and report, but like the other tools mentioned, it cannot be used in isolation. Work has to necessarily be done on top of the output, because of false positives and false negatives, for example.

As every pentesting process, context is crucial, and these automated scanners do NOT have it all laid out for them. Human intervention, at least for now, is mandatory.
