# pmpa-cool-notes
Notes I wrote for the PMPA coruse/certificate by TCM, covering basic aspects of the Android application architecture and reverse engineering. They were meant to be memos during the exam, and served me well. The Injured Android flags walkthroughs are incomplete, but you can find all the flags and their solution in the [Injured Android](https://github.com/B3nac/InjuredAndroid/blob/master/InjuredAndroid-FlagWalkthroughs.md) repository.
